<!--
        I got my CDN from here (https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/#).
        You can replace the src tag with the url of your asset. Make sure it is a direct url. -->

    <button>Hi</button>

    <!-- HTML is so cool that you can add script from almost any programming language. However, only javascript allows for <script> tags. You will have to use another type of tag and maybe import a library to use another programming language. -->
    <!-- Notice our comment symbols change inside the <script> tags, that's because it functions as Javascript inside the browser! -->

      /* LOOK AT THE JQUERY DOCUMENTATION. Documentation and API just refers to a set of functions that you can look at to see what you can do. It's basically a dictionary. Here's the link to Jquery's:

      http://api.jquery.com/ */

      /* BTW, javascript, java, and jquery are all separate things. Javascript is what browsers can recognize automatically, Jquery is a library we can use to do specific things with our code. Read up on the history with a quick Google search. */

        $("button").click(function (event) { // that button we made in html? Go ahead and do this function if it gets clicked on.
            alert("Thanks for visiting!"); // send a popup alert thanking the user for using this wonderful site.
